# renoir_engine

This is the "development" version: it should not be used with legacy applications.

TODO:
	- Really separate concerns in different modules (HTML tools, imaging tools, general tools, ORM...)
	- Create namespaces for all these things.
	- Maybe translate.
	- Perhaps finally solve the whole "protected $property" debacle.
