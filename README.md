# renoir_engine

This is the "legacy" version: the engine as it is needed to work with existing applications.

TODO for a new version, in a new repository:

	- Really separate concerns in different modules (HTML tools, imaging tools, general tools, ORM...)
	- Create namespaces for all these things.
	- Maybe translate.
	- Perhaps finally solve the whole "protected $property" debacle.
